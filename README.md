# Logging Example

In this example, we will develop a logging library.      

Please note that this is only an example, used to introduce you to some software engineering challenges and techniques.
In a real product, you would use an existing logging library , such as [log4j](http://logging.apache.org/log4j/2.x/), [logback](http://logback.qos.ch/), and/or [slf4j](http://www.slf4j.org/).

We start with a simple [`Main`](src/csc301/loggingExample/Main.java) class that uses a print statement to print debug messages to the console.

__New Requirement:__ We want to easily turn debug messages on/off.

Let's see how we handle this case in [step 2](../tree/step2).
